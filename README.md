# Memo-zy
Welcome to Memo-zy, my first Spring Boot project!

## Technologies Used
- Spring Boot
- Gradle
- JPA (Java Persistence API)
- Thymeleaf
- H2 Database

## What I've Learned
1. I started my Spring Boot journey by enrolling in this course. Through [the course](https://www.inflearn.com/course/%EC%8A%A4%ED%94%84%EB%A7%81-%EC%9E%85%EB%AC%B8-%EC%8A%A4%ED%94%84%EB%A7%81%EB%B6%80%ED%8A%B8), I gained valuable knowledge on Spring Boot fundamentals, including how to handle the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern, as well as performing basic Create and Read operations on the H2 Database.

2. In addition to my course learnings, I further expanded my skills by researching how to perform Update and Delete operations on the H2 Database. This process has helped me deepen my understanding of database interactions with Spring Boot.

## Ongoing Challenges
- I am currently focusing on mastering Thymeleaf to enhance the frontend of the project.
- If you come across the error message "org.springframework.web.HttpRequestMethodNotSupportedException: Request method 'POST' not supported", I recommend exploring Thymeleaf configurations to address this issue effectively.
